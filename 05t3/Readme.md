# 05t3's Learning Journey

Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20px"> my name is 05t3 and i'm happy You are hereüòÅ. Welcome to my 15days of learning the in's & out's of windows OS. For the longest time, i've been hooked to pwning linux boxes and kinda ignored the windows bit. In this journey i purpose to go go deeper in different sections such as active directory, windows processes, tools used to enumerate linux, windows registry, using powershell like a pro...etc.

I will focus my attention on both blue and red team Ops.

I Hope this will be a great learning experience for you as well.
